# Employee Attrition Prediction Model

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze employee data and build a predictive model that can help organizations identify potential attrition risks. The model is designed to assist HR departments in making informed decisions regarding employee retention strategies.

## Contents

- `attrition.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to employee demographics, job roles, performance, and attrition status. It is assumed that the dataset is pre-loaded into the notebook and is accessible as `X_train` and `X_test`.

## Code Structure

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Load the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

2. **Model Training**: 
   - Train a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, etc.) to predict employee attrition based on the processed features.

3. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

4. **Predictions**: 
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset and analyze the results.

## Usage

1. Open the `attrition.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run each cell sequentially to execute the code.
3. Modify the code as needed to experiment with different models, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics.

## Metrics

The following metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

## Future Improvements

- Explore advanced machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods.
- Implement hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Conduct feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of the model.
- Increase the dataset size for better generalization.
